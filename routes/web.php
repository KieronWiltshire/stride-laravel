| Web Routes

| Here is where you can register web routes for your application. These
| routes are loaded by the RouteServiceProvider within a group which
| contains the "web" middleware group. Now create something great!
|
| It should be noted that overriding the home/index route here will
| cause some aspects of OAuth to break as the "web" middleware group
| utilizes the "session" instead of the "passport" authentication guard.
